-- Immediate --
Test on cray, fx10, sx-ace
Setup buildbot tests using "make check"
LBT mpi <- ICELL is being calculated from localBounds
move contents of macros.h to configure.ac
args.h, verify.h from class to namespace
Have only one P2P
SIMD for Helmholtz P2P
Helmholtz DTT
Fix without TBB
logger.h split to print.h
bodies -> bodies + fields, bodyPos -> bodies, bodyAcc -> fields
AoS, SoA union by Strzodka
examples/Makefile options to args
Use compressed Cell struct of Bonsai
Don't try to instantiate all the classes at the top (wait until useful parameters are ready)
Separate key manipulation namespace, e.g. interleaveMorton(), deinterleveHilbert() (controllable key_t)
Distinguish Pmax and P. Make P runtime option
Use getIndex for NO_P2P

-- Features to add --
Time each kernel separately using cycle counters
cycle counter based weights
TBB -> OpenMP with atomics -> flush
MPI-3.0 lock all
Kahan + fixed precision
Solid harmonics kernel
Morton -> Hilbert
splitRange defined in both dataset.h and partition.h
UVWX-list with precomputation
2:1 refinement for precomputation
Periodic B.C. by one precomputed translation matrix
Teng's BH MAC with M2P option during DTT
non-orthogonal recursive bisection
Integrate with /gpu
Interface with BEM code

-- GPU integration --
CUDA 6.0 debug
Unify dataset
.h -> .cxx/.cu
MPI Bonsai
Ewald, VdW
Zero softening

-- Comparisons --
DTT vs. UVWX-list
Separate +- tree vs. Single tree
Cartesian vs. Spherical (optimized)
ORB vs. HOT

-- Debugging tips --
Write the kind of code where standard gcc can catch the bug, exceptions, assertions
Add assertions and keep them there
Shift bodies
traverseLET 0 distance
graft 0
serial mimic parallel

-- Issues --
charmm2: remove repartition inside Ewald & VdW
Intel OpenMP error
